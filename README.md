## About Me

Hi I'm Aaron Hardin. ðŸ‘‹ I mostly focus on C# but enjoy the differences about different languages. I currently live in Texas (USA) and am learning Japanese with the intention of working (and living) there.

I'm currently learning golang and would love any feedback on my latest project: [gopher-money](https://github.com/aaron-hardin/gopher-money)
